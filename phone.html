    <p class="sanserif"> Chris reaches in his pocket and pulls out his phone. He touches the screen but no response.
      Just then it he recalls
    with a grimace, he had left a battery draining app on in his phone. His phone is dead! In a fit of rage
    he throws his phone on the ground and curses Zeus, the Phyiscs gods, and some other deities.

  <p class="sanserif"> He knows what he must do. Chris gathers his books and other materials and
   prepares for the treacherous journey ahead. He takes a shot of some 3 hour old coffee from the desk and
   mentaly prepares to explore the halls. Suddenly he sees a computer screen in his peripherials with a strange
  screen saver. Does he dare check it out, or will he explore the halls...
