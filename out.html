<p> The decsion was made, Chris wants nothing to do with the horrify sounds of the machine.
He decided to go down a large corridor to his left. He travels down the hall for what seems like
days. He starts to subtly become discouraged and wonders if he'll ever get out of the building.
Chris then notices a dimly lite door number he could swear he passed already. He passes it again a few
minutes later. Chris says aloud to himself,"how could this be". "I'm trapped forever!"

<p> Just then Chris stirs in his bed. He finds himself in his room. He let's out a laugh and sigh of relief at
the same time. It was all a dream, thank goodness. Chris returns to sleep wondering if  his
fellow students will get a chuckle out of the story.
