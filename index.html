  <p class="sanserif"> Chris is a brillent, hard working physics student.
  One evening in particular, down in the Physics building, Chris worked way too hard
  and far too long. He had fallen asleep. He suddenly awoke with a jerking motion. Chris immediately notices the clock on the
  wall."Bahhh! It's 2:30", Chris cries out as he realizes where he is in the middle of the night. He springs up to gather his things
  to leave, and notices he had forgoten his entrusted key to the building. Thoroughly frustrated, he realizes he must make a move.

Chris comes up with two ideas. He will either check his phone to see if there's anything or anyone that can help him,
or he will explore the halls of the physics building...after hours. He knows full well what dangers may lurk in the halls.
