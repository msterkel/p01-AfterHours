  <p>Our hero creeps towards a closed door where the noise seems to be coming from. He sees a dimlight escape from the
door seal which lightly alluminates his feet. Couragously he puts his ear to the door and hears the machine at work.
Just then Chris decides to swing the door open. His eyes could't believe what they where seeing.

<div style="float:right; width: 40%">
<p> It was his good friend Tucker. "Tucker what in the world are you doing here!", Chris shouts. Tucker looks up from the machine
with tired eyes and says, "probably the same reason your'e here; lost track of time working". Chris pauses
for a second then laughs heartily. "Come on Tucker", Chris cooly utters "let's go home".
