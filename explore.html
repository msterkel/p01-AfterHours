<p class="sanserif"> Chris finds himself in an erie hallway. Lights flicker on and off in a disturbing fashion.
He knows these halls well by day, but at night something is different. He can't quite put his finger on it. Chris knows
he doesn't have much time.

<div style="float:right; width: 40%">
<p class="sanserif"> All of a sudden a clangy mechanical sound peirces the cold silence of the halls.
  Chris couldn't identity the sound as his terror rose faster than his curiousity.
  Quickly he decides on two choices. He must either investigate the noise, or find a way out.
